# Ideas for chart design
- Violin plot superimposed on the scatter chart
- Overlapping the charts (different colors/opacity)
    - overlapping violin plots
- trendline
- have each of these be selectable/toggleable 

## Animation sequence
1. ~~Draw tendline on each chart~~
2. ~~Draw violin on each chart~~ Now a marigin line
3. ~~Animate Larger R value points to smaller R value points (or vice versa)~~
    - ~~along with the trendline and violin~~
    - ~~change color and opacity~~
