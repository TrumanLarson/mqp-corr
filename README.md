# Truman Larson Data Vis Final Project

In this repo contains my code, libraries I used, and my process book. 

### Libraries
- All of the code in the semantic-* folders are compondents from the semantic-ui library. 
- The convex-hull.js file is from [this](https://www.nayuki.io/page/convex-hull-algorithm) project.
- The base/chart.js and base/datagen.js files were provided by Lane Harrison and Yiren Ding
- The ellipse algorithm was also provided through Lane Harrison from other sources


### Code
All of the other code is written by myself or Madyson Kelly. 


### Features
The only non-obvious feature in this project is the click to toggle feature that is active when the merge option is selected.
